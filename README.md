## Lecture 37

Introduction to forms in html. Important tags are `<input>` and `<label>`. In addition, some important attributes are:

* `id`:   this is mostly used so that `<label>` can be matched to the `<input>`
* `name`: name of the input that will appear in the http request once form is submitted
* `type`: type of the input, e.g. radio, text, password, email
* `<select>`: this is the dropdown input, each option is enclosed in an `<option>` tag under the select.
* `placeholder`: a placeholder text option
* `selected`

## Lecture 61

Introduction to box model. We used html table and css to make a simple tic-tac-toe grid. Some important ideas are:

* `border`: we've actually seen this before in Lecture 52. Basically it's the border surrending your selector.
* `padding`: the distance between your content and your border.
* `margin`: the distance between your tag and other boxes.
* `border-collapse`: cool trick to make a continuous border

We further explored the use of box model to create a photo blog that scales dynamically with our window size.

## Lecture 67

We combine all we've learned about css so far to style a blog page.

* `max-width`: can be set in absolute unit and use with `width` in relative unit. `max-width` will be used until the window does not have enought room to accomodate it. Then the `width` scaling will be used.
* Include fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* Use of `<div>` tag to differentiate parts

## Lecture 81

This is the first **Bootstrap** exercise. In this project, we've included the bootstrap `navbar` as well as using the grid system (e.g. `col-lg-4`). In addition, we've also included icons from the **Font Awesome** library.
